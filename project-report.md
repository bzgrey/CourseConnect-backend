# 6.104 Project Report

## Design Summary

## Reflections
### Benny
As part of this project I learned and improved on many things. I improved on my ability to code concepts and syncs, and use the concept tool in the process. I also gained important experience in working in a team on building a webapp. I have also improved on my ability to use llms affectively while coding. I have enjoyed this process of working with a team and found that it is much more manageable than working individually on a project.
