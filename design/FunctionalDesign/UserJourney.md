Alex is a second‑year student trying to balance required cores with friends’ plans so they can share a lab section and keep one afternoon free for a club. Up to now, Alex has juggled spreadsheets and screenshots, always discovering too late that friends picked conflicting recitations.

Login & Landing (User Page)
After signing in, Alex arrives at the User Page. The Friends panel shows three confirmed friends; the Groups panel lists “6.104 Project Team.” Alex adds a new friend (Dana) so their tentative schedule will become comparable. Spotting one persistent distraction source, Alex uses the Foes (Blocking) area to block a former classmate—immediately ensuring that person cannot view Alex’s schedule.

Moving to Scheduling (Scheduling Page)
Alex opens the Scheduling Page. The Friend Dropdown is used to select Dana plus the project team group. The composite overlay highlights overlapping planned lectures and gaps. A conflict appears: Alex’s chosen lab for a course collides with Dana’s preferred recitation window.

Refining with Search Filtering
Alex types “6.004” into the search filter. Filtered course options appear quickly; Alex inspects a section’s Course Description panel and sees two friends already considering a particular lab. Preferencing is applied—meaning his friends will likely take the course.

Conflict Resolution
Seeing the schedule alignment (friends prefer the same lab), Alex removes the previously conflicting lab event and adds the mutually favored one. The schedule updates; a free Thursday block emerges, preserving time for the club activity. Group members’ views (except any blocked users) now reflect Alex’s adjusted tentative plan.

Privacy Recheck
Before leaving, Alex revisits the User Page to confirm the earlier block is still in effect. Confidence in control reduces social pressure—no unwanted visibility despite broader sharing.

Ongoing Iteration
Over the week, Dana tweaks a morning lecture; Alex, noticing the change via the comparison view, downgrades preference on a now-crowded recitation and promotes an alternative section, keeping coordination fluid without forcing identical schedules.

Outcome
Alex converts a previously solitary, error‑prone process into a transparent, consensual planning loop:

Friends and groups supply context only after mutual agreement.
Blocking enforces boundaries instantly.
Preferencing surfaces alignment without mandating choices.
Search + side‑by‑side schedule comparison accelerates conflict resolution.
By registration time, Alex enters official enrollment with a socially aware, ethically safeguarded schedule—no scrambling, no pressure, clear control.
