# Flaws/ Opportunities

## 1. Duplicate usage of green to indicate "Likely" preference and event block on calendar view

* Confuses users into thinking the event block color corresponds to the "Likely" preference
* Fix: Change event block color

## 2. Preference selection of course above lecture/recitation times made it seem like you select a preference first

* Fix: Move preference selection below lecture/recitation times OR only display preferences after selection of some event associated with a course,

## 3. Not being able to compare a group member and some friends schedule in the calendar view

* Why: There wasn't an option in the "Groups\&Friends" dropdown to select "All", which displays all group members and friends together
* Fix: add an "All" option

## 4. Removing oneself as admin allowed other users to still request to join but pending joins couldn't be viewed

* Why: After one removes himself/herself as admin of a group, the group becomes "adminless", so pending join requests are not viewable or resolvable by anyone
* Fix: Only "Make Admin" choice available to users who are admins, so they can't remove their admin position without designating someone else as an admin thus pending join requests are viewable by someone again.

## 5. Clicking a group name again as admin to see a pending join request

* Why: The only way to see a pending join request is to click the group name and view the members list
* Fix: add some message (symbol) to indicate a pending join request
