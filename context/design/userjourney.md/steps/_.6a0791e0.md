# User Journey for CourseConnect

Meet the User:
Alex is a 20-year-old sophomore majoring in Computer Science. With registration season coming up, he wants to explore new classes and build his semester schedule—but juggling requirements, time conflicts, and keeping track of which friends are taking similar classes has always been a struggle. He’s heard about CourseConnect and decides to give it a try.

1. Exploring Courses in the Course Catalog

Scrolling through the homepage, Alex lands on the Course Catalog page (see sketch 1). The search bar and filters immediately catch his eye—he types in “software” and filters by HASS + CI-H to meet graduation requirements.

A list of results appears, including 6.104 – Software Design. It shows a quick overview: units, term availability, and rating. Everything he needs to know before even clicking deeper. Curious, he selects the course.

2. Viewing Class Details on the Course Page

Alex is taken to the Course Page (sketch 2). At the top, he sees a large course title: Software Design. The details are neatly arranged:

Units

Ratings

Level

Terms offered

Average enrollment

On the right side, there's a small panel showing which of his friends—based on the list he added earlier in the User Page—are taking or have bookmarked this course.

He’s sold. He taps the button: Add to Schedule.

3. Building a Weekly Plan on the Schedule Page

After clicking, he’s automatically redirected to the Schedule Page (sketch 3). A clean Mon–Fri calendar layout dominates the screen.

He sees Software Design slotted on Tuesday and Thursday from 11am–1pm. When he clicks on the course block, a side panel appears listing friends and groups who are also taking the class—exactly the social context he needs to decide if this class is worth taking.

He realizes a few of his group project partners from last year are enrolled. That seals the deal.

4. Returning to the User Page for Social Setup (Optional but powerful)

Before adding more classes, Alex revisits the User Page to clean up his friend list. He searches for “Maya” and adds her to his friends. He also creates a group called “6.104 Team” so he can easily see who joins him once the semester starts.

The Friends → Foes → Groups columns give him full control over how he organizes his people.

5. Final Outcome

Within 15 minutes, Alex has:

Browsed for classes

Added one to his schedule

Seen which friends are taking it

Started preparing his semester

Instead of juggling spreadsheets, registrar pages, and text chats, CourseConnect gave him one place to visualize everything—course data, social context, and schedules—all unfolding naturally through a smooth navigation path.

From confused browsing to confident scheduling—CourseConnect turns course planning from stressful to intuitive.
